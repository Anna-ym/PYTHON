Stoicism, a school of thought that flourished in Greek and Roman history of Classical antiquity.
It was one of the loftiest and most sublime philosophies in the record of Western civilization. 
In urging participation in human affairs, Stoics have always believed that the goal of all inquiry is to provide a mode of conduct characterized by tranquillity of mind and certainty of moral worth.
For the early Stoic philosopher, as for all the post-Aristotelian schools, knowledge and its pursuit are no longer held to be ends in themselves.
The Hellenistic Age was a time of transition, and the Stoic philosopher was perhaps its most influential representative.
A new culture was in the making.
The heritage of an earlier period, with Athens as its intellectual leader, was to continue, but to undergo many changes.
If, as with Socrates, to know is to know oneself, rationality as the sole means by which something outside of the self might be achieved may be said to be the hallmark of Stoic belief.
