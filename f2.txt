Stoicism, a school of thought that flourished in Greek and Roman history of Classical antiquity.
In urging participation in human affairs, Stoics have always believed that the goal of all inquiry is to provide a mode of conduct characterized by tranquillity of mind and certainty of moral worth.
The Hellenistic Age was a time of transition, and the Stoic philosopher was perhaps its most influential representative.
The heritage of an earlier period, with Athens as its intellectual leader, was to continue, but to undergo many changes.
